## What is Curation?

Curation is a process of making biological data organized, annotated, and standardized to make it a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) resource.

- **Findable** - to assign an persistent identifier that would make data easy to find by both humans and machines
- **Accessible** - to be able to retrieve the data by their identifier using a standard protocol
- **Interoperable** - to use standardized terms and have references to other data and be machine actionable
- **Reusable** - to sufficiently describe data for both computers and humans to be able to understand the data

Using a structured FAIR data/database can fast-track the drug development process as it make it easier for researchers to test their first-hand hypotheses.


## How is Data Curated on OA?

Curated datasets stored on Polly are a result of a multi-step process that ensures the overall quality and reusability of the data. In summary, all data sets on Polly go through the following two-step process:-

- Data Engineering - This includes transforming data to fit a proprietary data schema that is uniform across several datatypes. The transformation streamlines data in one consistent schema and allows users to query multiple data types on a single data infrastructure.
- Harmonizing Metadata - This involves tagging each sample and dataset with a metadata harmonized with uniform ontology.


## Why is Data Curation Important?

Manually curating vast volumes of unstructured or semi-structured biomedical data for drug development can be expensive, cumbersome, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Automating the curation process would ensure the following -

- High data quality
- Data will be reusable for any kind of analysis
- Recently added datasets could also be quickly curated

## Curated Fields on Polly

On Polly, all datasets and the corresponding samples are available with six standard metadata fields which are curated using Polly's proprietary NLP-based Polly-BERT models and harmonized with specific biomedical ontologies. Such fields are Organism, Disease, Tissue, Cell Line, Cell Type and Drug. In addition to these fields, other metadata fields are also available which are extracted from the source metadata. Curated metadata on Polly is available at 3 levels:

- Dataset-level metadata - General information about the experiment, subject and transformations, for eg, organism, experiment type, and disease under study.
- Sample-level metadata - Captures information for each sample. Eg. Drug, tissue
- Feature-level metadata: Provides molecular/gene information that is consistent across samples.

The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into nearby tissues. T's may be further divided to provide more detail, such as T3a and T3b. The number value ranges from 1 to 4, with size 1 for the smallest and size 4 for the largest. </li><li> N (Regional lymph nodes N) - N refers to the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer. The value ranges from 0-3 where 0 means no lymph nodes and N1, N2, and N3 refers to the number and location of lymph nodes that contain cancer. The higher the number after the N, the more lymph nodes that contain cancer. </li><li> M (Distant metastasis M) - M refers to whether cancer has metastasized, where 0 means it has not metastasized and 1 means it has. </li></ul> <br/> X after T, N or M (TX/NX/MX) means the main tumor, lymph nodes cancer or metastasis cannot be measured respectively. <br/> 2. **Number staging system** - For many cancers, the TNM combinations are grouped into five less-detailed stages. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues. <ul><li> Stage 0 - Cancer (abnormal cells) is present but has not spread. </li><li> Stage 1 - Cancer is present. It is small in size but has not spread. </li><li> Stage 2 - Cancer has grown but still has not spread. </li><li> Stage 3 - Cancer is larger and may have spread to the surrounding tissues and/or lymph nodes. </li><li> Stage 4 - Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body (at least to 1 other body organ). Such cancer is known as "secondary" or "metastatic" cancer. </li></ul> 3. **Cancer Grade System** - Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and the tumor tissue look under a microscope. The following values are given for the cancer grade label:Grade X (GX) - Cancer grade cannot be assessed. <ul><li> Grade 1 (G1) - Well-differentiated cells. Cancer cells resemble normal cells and aren't growing rapidly. G1 represents a low grade. </li><li> Grade 2 (G2) - Moderately differentiated cells. Cancer cells don't look like normal cells and are growing faster than normal cells. G2 represents intermediate grade. </li><li> Grade 3 (G3) - Poorly differentiated cells. Cancer cells look abnormal and may grow or spread more aggressively. G3 represents a high grade. </li><li> Grade 4 (G4) - Undifferentiated cells. G4 represents a high grade. </li></ul> <br/> Therefore, for each sample, the fields for cancer and stage are as follows: <br/> **T** : Stores the T values from the TNM system.Examples:, T2, TX, T1a <br/> **N** : Stores the N values from the TNM system. Examples: N2, NX, N1b <br/> **M** : Stores the M values from the TNM system. Examples : M2, MX, M1c <br/> **Stage** : Stores the value for the number staging system.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tissue | This field represents the tissue(s) from which the samples originated. Tissue labels already present in the source metadata are normalized using a normalization model. In cases where tissue labels are missing, related texts and abstracts are processed and further normalized to get the tissue metadata label. <br/> Tissue labels are annotated for samples extracted from healthy or diseased tissue. All labels are harmonized with Brenda Tissue Ontology. | Tissue | curated\_tissue |
| Disease | At the sample level, this field represents the disease associated with a particular sample. Disease labels already present in the source metadata are normalized using a normalization model. In case the disease labels are missing, related texts and abstracts are processed and further normalized to get the disease metadata label. <br/> Disease labels are annotated for a sample when the samples have been collected from diseased tissue or organism. Examples of such cases are as follows: <ul><li> If the cell line has been extracted from a diseased organism/tissue and been immortalised for further study then it will be annotated for the disease. For example, if the samples under study are extracted from osteosarcoma tumor then disease annotation for this sample will be "osteosarcoma" </li><li> If a disease model has been created through genetic modification or has been artificially created in lab for further studies, then it will be annotated for that disease. For example, a genetically engineered mouse model where an immunodeficient or humanized mouse is implanted with a tissue from a patient's tumor. <br/> At the sample level, disease labels are annotated for the following sample type: <ul><li> Clinical- Samples extracted from diseased patients, tissue, cell lines etc. </li><li> GEM (Genetically Engineered Models) - Samples extracted from genetically engineered mouse models </li><li> Diet Induced - Samples extracted from diet induced mouse models </li><li> Xenograft - Samples extracted from patient-derived xenograft or cell line derived xenograft mouse models </li><li> Infection - Samples extracted from infected organisms, tissues, cell lines or cultures.

### Cell Type Annotation for single cell datasets: Manual Curation Process

Cell-type labels are assigned at the cell cluster level based on expression signatures using ontology or controlled vocabularies. For datasets, where cell-type annotations are not available from the source (mainly GEO datasets), we manually curate the cell-type information based on the differential marker expression for clusters. In cases where cell type annotations are already available in datasets at source, datasets are not manually re-curated.

#### **Process flow:**![](RackMultipart20230105-1-c8jebh_html_4bc6d9e79751d236.png)

#### **I) Manual identification of the cell types and markers from Publications** -

Internal curators determine if a particular dataset can be curated for cell type by going through the publications associated with the dataset. In publications, the information on cell type and the corresponding marker is present either in the figures (UMAP, T-SNE plots), text or supplementary files. If this information is not present, then such datasets are marked as 'Not Curatable'. The following types of studies fall under the category of 'Not curatable' datasets.

- Single Cell Type Study - The whole study was done on only one cell type.
- Lineages - The study included the lineage of one cell type. Example - T helper cells, T memory cells etc.
- Cell Cycle Studies - In this study the differential markers were studied for the G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle for a particular cell type.
- Methods - Different analysis methods were studied
- Publications having \< 2000 cells - These publications used methods which could not be reproduced. Therefore, these were not curated.
- Publication not available
- Marker information not available in the publication
  - Marker Cell Type Info Absent
  - Marker Info Absent
- Time Point
- Cell lines
- Transitional Cells
- Cell Type Info Absent
- Embryonic Development
- Organoids
- Others

#### II) Metadata addition- Annotation of clusters

The process of cell-type cluster annotation for curatable datasets is based on the general scRNASeq general[workflow](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html) using the Scanpy library with steps as shown below in the figure:

UMAP/tSNE plots are generated as a result of single-cell raw count processing. By visualization of clusters with UMAP/t-SNE plots, cell type cluster annotation is done.

##### 1. Cluster annotation with raw cell type (cell type terminology used in publication):

Based on the marker expression value for each cluster, the cell type is annotated to the cluster. This annotation is added as a field named curated\_raw\_cell\_type. The raw cell type cluster annotation is compared with cell type annotation from the publication such as:

- All or most cell types are annotated
- UMAP is structurally similar to the one in the publication
- Relative proportions of cell types are matching
- Relative positions of cell types are matching
- Ontological terms and marker information are added for the cell type

##### 2. Ontological terms and marker information:

1. Cell type ontology + ontology ID: Cell-type annotation corresponding to Cell Ontology. This is given as the field named: curated\_cell\_type
2. Marker information: Gene name/names that are differentially expressed in the cluster
  - curated\_marker\_present: Gene name/names that are differentially expressed in the cluster
  - curated\_marker\_absent: Gene name/names that are absent in the cluster

**NOTE** : For manual cell type curation, datasets should be available on Polly.
