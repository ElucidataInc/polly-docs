Every year, vast amounts of biological multi-omics data are being generated and deposited on public repositories by academic labs and organizations worldwide. These data hold tremendous potential for reuse and discovery but are scattered across multiple, disparate sources and lack standardization. Thus, the availability of data does not equate to its easy usability. This makes the need for an efficient means of exploring molecular data an immediate necessity. 

Additionally, no single type of data, be it metabolomic, proteomic or genomic, will be sufficient to capture the complexity of biological phenomena. Adopting an integrated approach could significantly aid the ability to gain a more holistic and accurate understanding of human physiology and disease pathology at the molecular level. 
OmixAtlas aims to address these issues by providing access to ML-ready biology-centric data from public repositories.

# What is Liver OmixAtlas?

**Elucidata’s Liver OmixAtlas**, the largest, multi-omics collection of liver tissue-derived data from human, mouse and rat. It contains 9 different types of data derived from 10 public sources, encompassing normal as well as perturbed (disease, drug treatment, gene knockout/knockdown, etc.) states of liver tissue.

# Why did we build a Liver OmixAtlas?

Every year, vast amounts of biological multi-omics data are being generated and made public by academic labs and organizations worldwide. These data hold tremendous potential for reuse and discovery but are scattered across multiple, disparate sources and lack standardization. Thus, the availability of data does not equate to its easy usability, making the need for an efficient means of exploring molecular data an immediate necessity. 

Additionally, biological systems and processes are intrinsically complex. No single type of data, be it metabolomic, proteomic or genomic, will be sufficient to capture the complexity of biological phenomena. Adopting an integrated approach could significantly aid the ability to gain a holistic and more accurate understanding of physiology and disease pathology at the molecular level. 

Elucidata’s Liver OmixAtlas addresses the above issues by ensuring that the metadata across different public resources have been curated and harmonized and made ready for downstream machine learning and analytical applications.

# What are the key features of Liver OmixAtlas?

1. Multi-omics data in one place
  a) Liver OmixAtlas provides access to 9 different types of data from ten public sources

2. Continuously evolving
  a) In keeping with the rapid pace of biological data generation, Liver OmixAtlas is updated with a frequency that is in sync with the source repositories, wherever applicable

3. ML-ready data made available through **Curation**
  a) All types of data from diverse sources have been structured, metadata have been harmonized with controlled vocabularies and ontologies and made ready for downstream ML- applications

4. Integratability
  a) Liver Omix Atlas is made available on Polly’s data infrastrucutre, which allows querying of the data through point and click solutions and advanced querying through polly libraries. Code-based advanced access means that you can use these data on Polly or outside of Polly on a platform of your choice.
