### Metadata Charts

Metadata charts consist of the experimental factors along with a sunburst plot. The Sunburst Plot is used to display a hierarchical structure. Each level of the hierarchy is represented by one ring or circle and all rings show how the outer rings relate to the inner rings. To create a sunburst plot, the user can select the metadata in the rings based on their own criteria.
