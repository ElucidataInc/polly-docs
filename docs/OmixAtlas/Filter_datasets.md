How to filter Datasets?
-----------------------

After shortlisting the datasets using a search bar, users can further find the desired datasets using the 'Filter Datasets' function present on the above. These filters are configurable and may be different for different Atlasses.

For a standard Atlas, following filters are available:

- Cell Line

Users can filter datasets by searching for desired cell lines using following three options from a drop down menu -

- Cell lines
- Disease cell line
- Tissue specific cell line

If users choose a disease, cell lines related to that disease are shown and not the disease itself.

Users can perform ontology-based searches for cell lines and refine them using specific options related to cell lines, diseases, and tissues.
