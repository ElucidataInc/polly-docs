| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Organism | This field represents the organism from which the samples originated. Organism labels already present in the source metadata are normalized using a normalization model. In case the organism labels are missing, related texts and abstracts are processed and further normalized to get the organism metadata label. | [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) | Organism | curated\_organism |
| Tissue | This field represents the tissue(s) from which the samples in the dataset are derived. Tissue labels already present in the source metadata are normalized using a normalization model. In cases where tissue labels are missing, related texts and abstracts are processed and further normalized to get the tissue metadata label. <br/> Tissue labels for datasets consist of all tissue names from which the samples are derived. Tissue labels are annotated for samples extracted from a healthy tissue or a diseased tissue. <br/> Key specifications for tissue metadata annotations are as follows: <ul><li> All labels are harmonized with Brenda Tissue Ontology </li><li> Dual Channel datasets where the author has studied two different cases in a single sample are not curated with tissue metadata </li><li> Datasets with numerical metadata are not annotated </li></ul> | [Brenda Tissue Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/bto). | Tissue | curated\_tissue |

| Control | This field indicates whether the sample is a control or a perturbation for a particular experiment. | curated\_control |
| Cancer Stage - TNM Stage | This field represents the cancer stage of the clinical samples which have disease labels as cancer. The cancer stage information is labelled in terms of the TNM staging system as well as the number staging system. <br/> **The TNM Staging System** - The TNM system is the most widely used cancer staging system. <ul><li> T (Primary Tumor T) - T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor. The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into nearby tissues. T's may be further divided to provide more detail, such as T3a and T3b. The number value ranges from 1 to 4, with size 1 for the smallest and size 4 for the largest. </li><li> N (Regional lymph nodes N) - N refers to the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer. The value ranges from 0-3 where 0 means no lymph nodes and N1, N2, and N3 refers to the number and location of lymph nodes that contain cancer. The higher the number after the N, the more lymph nodes that contain cancer. </li><li> M (Distant metastasis M) - M refers to whether cancer has metastasized, where 0 means it has not metastasized and 1 means it has. </li></ul> <br/> X after T, N or M (TX/NX/MX) means the main tumor, lymph nodes cancer or metastasis cannot be measured respectively. <br/> **T** : Stores the T values from the TNM system.Examples:, T2, TX, T1a <br/> **N** : Stores the N values from the TNM system. Examples: N2, NX, N1b <br/> **M** : Stores the M values from the TNM system. Examples : M2, MX, M1c | curated\_cancer\_tnm\_stage |
| Cancer Stage - Number Stage | **Number staging system** - For many cancers, the TNM combinations are grouped into five less-detailed stages. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues. <ul><li> Stage 0 - Cancer (abnormal cells) is present but has not spread. </li><li> Stage 1 - Cancer is present. It is small in size but has not spread. </li><li> Stage 2 - Cancer has grown but still has not spread. </li><li> Stage 3 - Cancer is larger and may have spread to the surrounding tissues and/or lymph nodes. </li><li> Stage 4 - Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body (at least to 1 other body organ). Such cancer is known as "secondary" or "metastatic" cancer. </li></ul> | curated\_cancer\_stage |
| Cancer Stage | This field represents the cancer grade of the clinical samples which have disease labels as cancer. <br/> Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and the tumor tissue look under a microscope. The following values are given for the cancer grade label: <ul><li> Grade X (GX) - Cancer grade cannot be assessed. </li><li> Grade 1 (G1) - Well-differentiated cells. Cancer cells resemble normal cells and aren't growing rapidly. G1 represents a low grade. </li><li> Grade 2 (G2) - Moderately differentiated cells. Cancer cells don't look like normal cells and are growing faster than normal cells. G2 represents intermediate grade. </li><li> Grade 3 (G3) - Poorly differentiated cells. Cancer cells look abnormal and may grow or spread more aggressively. G3 represents a high grade. </li><li> Grade 4 (G4) - Undifferentiated cells. G4 represents a high grade. </li></ul> <br/> | curated\_cancer\_grade |
