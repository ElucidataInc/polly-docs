## What is an Atlas?

Atlas, designed to revolutionize how translational teams manage and curate various types of data. Atlas combines the flexibility and user experience of spreadsheets with the **scalability, data integrity, and queryability** of relational databases.

**Atlas is a relational database that is powered by Elucidata’s Harmonization Engine which ingests, curates, and harmonizes diverse data types across preclinical and clinical domains to create analysis-ready data.**

It is a collection of tables with a user-defined schema, designed to handle your data management and analysis needs at scale. With Polly Atlas, you can create flexible table schemas that fit into your organization’s data workflows, ensuring high data integrity through features like uniqueness constraints, vocabulary checks, foreign key constraints, and ontology links. Polly Atlas supports custom data models for each atlas and accommodates multi-modal and longitudinal data, eliminating the need to modify entire GCTs or H5AD files.


## What are the user benefits/features of Atlas?


### User benefits


| **Working with Data at Source** | **How our Atlases can help** |
| --- | --- |
| Finding clinical or multi-omics data relevant to your project can take weeks as data is semi-structured and scattered across internal & public databases | Multi-modal data specific to a disease, tissue or research project can be aggregated from multiple sources in one place. Querying relevant data from this corpus takes minutes. |
| Preparing data for AI/ML or advanced analyses takes time and effort that could better be spent on insight generation. | Data in an Atlas will be pre-processed through a standard ETL pipeline and enriched with harmonized, scientifically relevant metadata. |
| Considerable time spent on switching platforms, UI and navigating between sources. | All data can be accessed and analyzed from one location, on a computational infrastructure of your choice. |



### Key features


- Centralized access to thousands of project-specific data from various sources

- Multiple data types can be mapped to a data model of choice and stored together on an Atlas. 

- Data is harmonized according to your choice of ontologies & data standards. 

- Atlas can be utilized on Elucidata’s Cloud platform, Polly, or your computational infrastructure of choice. 

- Built-in advanced search capabilities to query at the dataset, sample, or feature level (through code or GUI). 

- Ability to integrate with any BI tool, web app, dashboards, etc. with APIs for further analysis & visualization.
