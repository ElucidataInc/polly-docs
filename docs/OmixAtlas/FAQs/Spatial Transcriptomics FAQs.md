# Introduction

Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge scientific method that merges the study of gene expression with precise spatial location within a tissue. This revolutionary approach allows researchers to visualize the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts within a tissue sample, essentially mapping out where each gene is being expressed. Traditional transcriptomics analyses gene expression in bulk tissue samples or single cells but lacks spatial information. 

Polly can bring in SRT data from a variety of public sources as per the needs as long as the raw counts matrix, spatial coordinates, imaging data, and metadata are available. Some of the common public sources for Spatial Transcriptomics data are:

1. Gene Expression Omnibus
2. Single Cell Portal
3. Zenodo
4. CZI-CellxGene
5. Publications
