(A - search feature; B - Numbers of total samples and datasets)

The numbers of total and normal samples are displayed under each OmixAtlas. A search feature is also available to browse the collection of OmixAtlases.


## 2. OmixAtlas Summary Page

Once the user chooses an OmixAtlas, a summary page offers an overview of the OmixAtlas.The number of total datasets is visible just above the search bar (refer to A in Figure 2). General details such as the number of tissues, diseases, organisms, drugs, cell types and cell lines are displayed above a graphical summary as shown in the figure (refer to C in Figure 2).

## View all data

There are two formats that users can see datasets - Card view and Table view.

### 3.1 Card View

In this view, datasets are arranged as a list of horizontal cards. Each card contains a short summary of the dataset followed by color-coded metadata tags that define the characteristics of the dataset. Metadata information includes ontology backed annotations such as organism, disease, tissue, drug, cell type, cell line, etc. Card view offers a first-pass view of all the datasets that are queryable and searchable on an OmixAtlas. The search bar can be used to search for keywords that are present across source metadata (title, description etc) and curated metadata (such as drug, tissue, cell type etc) [Link here].The search results can be narrowed down using the dynamic filtering options on the left side.

#### 3.1.1 Datasets under Card View

The individual dataset consists under card view consists of the following -

1. Title : This describes the title of the study the dataset is taken from.

### 3.2 Table View

In table view, the results are organized as tables on the OmixAtlas interface with metadata fields presented as columns. Users can sort across metadata fields such as dataset id, no. of samples, description, drugs, cell type, cell line, disease and so on. The results show up in order of relevance to their search query. There is also a sorting function available next to the column header to view the sorted results in ascending or descending order.

Figure 15 - Table View

Users can customize columns in a table by clicking on the 'Gear' icon and selecting the required columns. Users can also fix columns by clicking on the 'Pin' icon.

### 3.3 Color codes

Each curated dataset in OmixAtlas is curated into different fields that are also color coded for easy identification. Following are the color codes decoded -

- Pink - Disease
- Turquoise - Organism
- Purple - Cell Type
- Blue - Cell Line
- Orange - Drug
- Green - Tissue
- Yellow - Data Type
- Mustard - Source

### 5.2 Metadata

The metadata section consists of a dashboard showcasing charts displayed for different metadata attributes such as disease, cell type and tissue type. There is an option to view the metadata either in graphical format or a tabular format.

The graphical format displays pie-charts/histograms for different attributes. Users can click on legends to select and filter the graphs.
