**Note:**

*   The admin dashboard is only accessible to users who have been provided the *Admin* user role. If no one in your group is able to access the admin dashboard, reach out to our team at [polly@elucidata.io](mailto:polly@elucidata.io).

## Create New User

To create a new user click on the *Create New User* button highlighted below.

![Create new user](../img/Admin_Dashboard/02_Admin_Dashboard_Overview.png) <center>**Figure 2.** Create new user</center>

A modal window will open up on the right. For each new account you will have to provide the first name, last name, email id and role; *User* or *Admin*. Assign *Admin* to those users who should have access to the admin dashboard and therefore the authority to create or manage users for your group.

**Note:**

*   While the first name, last name and role can be edited in the future, the email id cannot be modified. In case there is an error with the email id, delete the user following the steps mentioned [here](#delete-user) and create a new user with the correct details.

## Reset Password

Whenever a new account is created, a temporary password is sent to the email id which is required to log in. This temporary password expires **30 days** after it has been sent. In case a user does not log in during that time, they will require a new temporary password which can be sent using this option.

Click on the meatball menu for the relevant user and then click on *Edit*.

## Filter User

To filter users click on the *Filter Users* drop down menu. Currently, you can filter users by their account status; *Active* or *Inactive*. By default all accounts created are active. An account will only show up as inactive if disabled by an admin following the steps mentioned [here](#disable-user).
