*    The middle panel shows you all the content within the selected workspace.

*    The panel on the right shows you the details around the content within the workspace.

##Content within a workspace

A workspace contains all your data, [analyses](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html),[notebooks](https://docs.elucidata.io/Scaling%20compute/Polly%20Notebooks.html), and [reports](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html#reports). They can be accessed through the middle panel.
