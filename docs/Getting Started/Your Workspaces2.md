## Content within a workspace

A workspace contains all your data, [analyses](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html),[notebooks](https://docs.elucidata.io/Scaling%20compute/Polly%20Notebooks.html), and [reports](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html#reports). They can be accessed through the middle panel.

## Filtering the content

In order to reduce the clutter, workspaces allow you to filter the content you want to display within the middle panel. Click on *Filter icon* above the middle panel where you can select/deselect the file type you would want to show in the workspace. Once the selection is done click on *Apply* to confirm your selections.

The “Archive” Option appears in the Kebab Menu beside Workspace Name

- The archived workspaces are not deleted permanently. They can either be restored or deleted permanently at any point in time.
- The archived workspaces do not appear on the ‘Search’ results page.

- Users can restore their Workspaces using the ‘Restore Workspace’ option.
- All docs/files/folders associated with the Workspace will be restored to an Active State.

## Preview File And URL

For previewable file types (For example, csv files, notebooks, images, text files) - when a user clicks on a Workspace content to view details, there is an icon to preview and copy the URL of the workspace.

This option enables the user to share any file/folder/notebook without having to share the whole of the workspace.

![](../img/Workspace/24.png)  <p align=center>**Figure 23.** File Preview option</p>

The URL by default has restricted access, i.e the file can be viewed only by users who a part of the workspace and have the link.

The user also has the option to make the file link global i.e anyone with the link on Polly can view the file.
