## Creating a workspace

You can create a new workspace on Polly by clicking on *New Workspace* on the left panel of the workspace interface.

![New workspace2](../img/Workspace/createworkspace1.png) <p align=center>**Figure 4.** Creating a New Workspace</p>

Enter the Name of the workspace, custom tags and description (if any) and click on save. Users can add tags while creating a new workspace. These tags can be used later to search and identify workspaces.

## Content within a workspace

A workspace contains all your data, [analyses](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html),[notebooks](https://docs.elucidata.io/Scaling%20compute/Polly%20Notebooks.html), and [reports](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html#reports). They can be accessed through the center panel.

![Workspace Content](../img/Workspace/workspacecontent.png) <p align=center>**Figure 11.** Workspace Contents</p>


## Filtering the content

In order to reduce the clutter, workspaces allow you to filter the content you want to display within the middle panel. Click on *Filter icon* above the middle panel where you can select/deselect the file type you would want to show in the workspace. Once the selection is done click on *Apply* to confirm your selections.

## Creating a New folder

Polly workspace allows you to organize and manage your data in folders and subfolders. To create a folder, click on the *Create a New Folder* icon.

You can click on the same icon again to upload files within the created folder.

**Note:** 

*    Data files and notebooks can be organized within a folder while analyses are stored outside a folder in the selected workspace. In case of notebook uploads, the notebook are always uploaded in the root directory of the workspace (outside a folder). However, once uploaded, it can be moved to a folder if required.

*    Users will receive an email notification whenever they are added to a new workspace, their role changes, or they are removed from a workspace.


## Navigating through a folder

Double click on the folder name to look at its contents.

Users can edit name, add tags and description to a workspace. 


## Archival of Workspace

Having unused Workspaces result in unnecessary clutter, inefficiency in looking up things and excess storage costs. Users can hence “**Archive**”  Workspace/s from the list of Workspaces they’ve been working on or no longer need.


The “Archive” Option appears in the Menu beside Workspace Name

![](../img/Workspace/archieveworkspace.png)
![](../img/Workspace/archieveworkspace2.png) <p align=center>**Figure 20.** Archiving a Workspace</p>

- The archived workspaces are not deleted permanently. They can either be restored or deleted permanently at any point in time.
- The archived workspaces do not appear on the ‘Search’ results page.
- It will consist of all files & folders from the Active Workspace.The users can view the list of ‘Active’ and ‘Archived’ Workspaces and can also switch between them.

## Switching Between Active And Archived Workspaces

![](../img/Workspace/archieveworkspace3.png)

User can view the archived and active workspaces on the Home pagea and can switch between their Active and Archived Workspaces at any point in time.

## Restoring Archived Workspaces

![](../img/Workspace/archieveworkspace4.png)
![](../img/Workspace/permanentdelete.png)  <p align=center>**Figure 21.** Restoring archived Workspaces</p>

- Users can restore their Workspaces using the ‘Restore Workspace’ option.
- All docs/files/folders associated with the Workspace will be restored to an Active State.
- It will also restore access to all existing collaborators.
- Once a Workspace is restored, it is renamed to “OriginalWorkspaceName_Restored” to avoid confusion in case another Workspace with a similar name exists.

## Deleting a Workspace Permanently

- The users can delete a workspace permanently from their Archived section only.

## Preview File And URL

For previewable file types (For example, csv files, notebooks, images, text files) - when a user clicks on a Workspace content to view details, there is an icon to preview and copy the URL of the workspace.

This option enables the user to share any file/folder/notebook without having to share the whole of the workspace.

![](../img/Workspace/preview.png)  <p align=center>**Figure 23.** File Preview option</p>

The URL by default has restricted access, i.e the file can be viewed only by users who a part of the workspace and have the link.

The user also has the option to make the file link global i.e anyone with the link on Polly can view the file.

## Workspace Handling Guidelines and Limits

File supported per workspace ranges from 20000 to 30000

Workspace constraints for smooth usage are as follows:
<ul>
   <li>Search: There will be minimal to no impact
   <li>Copy: 100 - 110 GB total size with a cap of 100 files within a folder are allowed if done from UI
   <li>Move: Conditions are similar to that of copy
   <li>Delete: There will be no impact
      </ul>
