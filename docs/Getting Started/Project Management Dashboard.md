##Content within a project

A project contains all your [data](https://docs.elucidata.io/Getting%20Started/Project%20Management%20Dashboard.html#adding-files-to-your-workspace), [analysis](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html), [notebooks](https://docs.elucidata.io/Scaling%20compute/Polly%20Notebooks.html), and [reports](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Introduction.html#reports). They can be accessed through the top panel.

##Adding files to your workspace

*   Using GUI

New files can be added within a project by clicking on *Upload Files*. This will open up the upload interface which will allow you to upload files from your local storage as well as use our available integrations for different cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive and Box.

*   Using CLI

You can use PollyCLI as well to import your data directly within Polly. This is a more convenient option for uploading large data (more than a few GBs). The steps for the same are detailed [here](https://docs.elucidata.io/Scaling%20compute/Polly%20CLI.html).

##Creating a new folder

The project management dashboard allows you to store and manage your data in folders and sub-folders. To create a folder, click on *Create Folder*. Enter the name of the folder you want to create and click on *Create Folder*.
