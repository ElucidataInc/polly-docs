You can add the email of the Polly user you want to share the workspace with under *Add Collaborator*.

There are 2 types of workspace permission you can give to your users.

*    **Admin**: This permission allows the user to rename, add and delete files, analysis, code, and reports within the workspace. They can share the workspace and restore any analysis within it.

*    **Writer**: This permission allows the user to only add new files, analysis, code, and reports within the workspace. **They cannot delete anything from within the shared workspace**. They can also restore any analysis within the workspace but does not have the permission to share the workspace with others.


On selecting the desired permission, click *Add* to add the user to the list of collaborators. Once all the users are added, click on *Done*. You can check all collaborators for a workspace on the top panel at the right. Each collaborator is represented with a user icon.
