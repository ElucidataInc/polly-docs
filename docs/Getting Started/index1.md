We also offer a detailed on-boarding plan to get your team up and running on Polly as well as library of resources, videos and publications.

Our platform uses Intercom as a standard messenger launcher. A text bubble pops up, inquiring if you need help. Polly embeds this support to establish a dedicated customer success manager. Technical support is available from 9 AM to 8 PM EST and CET.
