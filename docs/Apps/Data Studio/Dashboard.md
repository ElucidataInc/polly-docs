# Dashboard

Data Studio lets you visualize your data with the number fo highly configurable charts and tables, which you can add to dashboards and then customize as needed. The Visualization Dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the selected visualization charts. The dashboard is customizable and can be organized in the most effective way to help you understand complex relationships in your data and can be used to create engaging and easy-to-understand reports.

The generated reports are interactive and can be shared with the collaborators. You can easily communicate and act on the customized data where all the members of your team can compare, filter and organize the exact data they need on the fly, in one report.

## Saving a Chart

In order to add a visualization to your dashboard, you first need to save it under the desired dashboard name.

In order to do that, click on the *Save* option present beside *Run Query* option.

## Inserting a Component

*    *Your charts and filters:* You can use this tab to sort your charts

*   *Tabs:* This option lets you create different tabs within the same dashboard


Let's say you have two plots in your dashboard. After you insert the component, just drag and drop the two charts. Once the two charts have been separated, label the tabs with the corresponding dataset names (or any desired name) represented in the charts.

*    *Header:* Lets you add a header to the dashboard

*    *Markdown:* In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. Within the *Insert* components pane, drag and drop a* Markdown*box on the dashboard. Now to edit the text, select the box. You can enter text in markdown format (see [this Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet") for more information about this format). You can toggle between *Edit* and *Preview* using the menu on the top of the box.
