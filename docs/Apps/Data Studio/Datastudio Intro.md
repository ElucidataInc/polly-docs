## What is Data Studio?

Data Studio application lets you explore data, make multiple workflows, and variate endlessly on those workflows. It allows the ingestion of all kinds of data and their combinations so that you can perform any analysis easily. The studio is made of smaller components that are split into various categories for ingestion, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing your data. You can select these components and arrange them according to your analysis needs to create your own custom workflow. You can also save a particular sequence of the components that can be reused again.

Furthermore, these components can be configured or custom components can be added by anyone to cater to their workflow requirements. Detailed documentation on the customization and creation of components can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rYCqOKuXc9hlRj1u-tNZoYN2_IlxnjVB/view?usp=sharing).
