#Introduction

##Overview

Calibration refers to the process of quantifying samples of unknown concentrations with known (standard) samples. Mass spec experiments are a crucial component of metabolomics experiments but the output obtained from software like [El-MAVEN](https://resources.elucidata.io/elmaven) and [MultiQuant](https://sciex.com/products/software/multiquant-software) are intensities which are unitless. From these intensities, we can calculate fractional enrichment and do relative comparisons. But for some analysis like kinetic flux analysis, we need absolute concentrations of the metabolites. These concentrations have units like M, μM, mM like any other chemical concentration. In order to absolutely quantify these metabolites, experiments are done with standard samples of known concentrations. QuantFit uses these data points to get mathematical mappings from intensities to concentrations which are subsequently used to calculate concentrations of experimental intensities.

##Scope of the app

*   Quantifies intensities obtained from El-MAVEN and MultiQuant using internal standards.

*   Supports quantification of metabolites and labeled fragments of metabolites.

*   Provides various curve fitting options like linear, exponential, log-log, polynomial and power.

#Getting Started

##User Input

QuantFit requires the following three files as input:

**Intensity file**

The intensity file is mandatory for both LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data and should be in either .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .txt format.  

The intensity file can be either in the long format.

![Sample intensity file in long format](../../img/QuantFit/MetaboliteIntensity.png) <center>**Figure 2.** Sample intensity file in long format</center>

where,

*   *Original Filename* is the Sample name

*   *Sample Name* is the Cohort name

*   *Component Name* is the Name of the metabolite

*   *Mass Info* is the Mass information of fragments

*   *Area* is the Intensities

Or it can be the .csv file exported after peak picking in El-MAVEN.

![Sample intensity file exported from El-MAVEN](../../img/QuantFit/metscape_intensity_file.png) <center>**Figure 3.** Sample intensity file exported from El-MAVEN</center>

**Metadata standard sample file**

The metadata standard file is mandatory for both LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data and should be in either .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .txt format. This file contains concentration information of the standard samples using which quantification is performed.

![Sample metadata standard file](../../img/QuantFit/Metadatastd.png) <center>**Figure 4.** Sample metadata standard file</center>

where,

*   *Original Filename* is the Standard sample name

*   *Sample Name* is the Standard cohort name

*   *Concentration* is the Concentration of standard samples

*   *Unit Info* is the Unit of concentration

*   *Unlabeled Fragment* is the Unlabeled fragment information

**Metadata mapping file**

The metadata mapping file is optional LC-MS but mandatory for LC-MS/MS data and should be in either .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .txt format. This file is required to map daughter fragments to their parent fragments.

![Sample metadata mapping file](../../img/QuantFit/Metadatamq.png) <center>**Figure 5.** Sample metadata mapping file</center>

where,

*   *Component Name* is the Name of the daughter fragments

*   *Formula* is the Formula of the particular daughter fragment

*   *Unlabeled Fragment* is the Name of the metabolite

*   *Isotopic Tracer* is the Element that was labeled

*   *Parent Formula* is the Formula of the parent fragment

##Steps involved in data processing

*   Process MS files using El-MAVEN or MultiQuant

*   Upload intensity files

*   Create/Upload metadata files

*   Adjust quantification parameters and Quantify

*   Download quantification files in CSV format

##Caveats

*   We use the entire standard and negate any background subtraction.

*   All isotopologue intensities are added to the parent intensity in case of labeled data.

*   Standard samples should contain “std” in their cohort name.

*   *Mass Info* column in the metabolite intensity file should be 0 throughout for LC-MS data

*   In case there are no cohorts in your data, the contents of *Sample Name* and *Original Filename* in the standard metadata file should be the same.

*   *Unlabeled Fragment* in the standard metadata file is the metabolite name for LC-MS data.

##Injection Efficiency Correction

Injection Efficiency Correction is used to normalize the biosamples with respect to internal standards in the data on the basis of total ion count. We recommend the highest intensity non-outlier sample when correcting for injection efficiency. You can also select a sample from the outliers detected with Grubbs' test for this normalization. 

To normalize intensities of metabolites present in the sample, by default we calculate a normalizing factor for each sample. This is calculated by dividing each intensity value by the maximum intensity value among the non-outlier samples. Then the intensity values of all metabolites in each sample is divided by the respective normalizing factor. You can also select this highest intensity sample from the list of outlier samples. QuantFit uses [Grubb's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubbs%27_test_for_outliers) to detect outliers from among the samples.

![Select internal standard metabolite and a sample for injection efficiency correction. ](../../img/QuantFit/InjectionEfficiencyCorrection.png) <center>**Figure 11.** Select internal standard metabolite and a sample for injection efficiency correction. </center>

##Quantification Dashboard

By default, linear quantification will be performed by the tool after performing the above-mentioned steps. However, you can optimize quantification by changing the curve fit to Polynomial, Exponential, LogLog or Power depending upon your data. In case you feel there is an outlier in your data, click on the sample and then on the “-” sign in the pop-up box as shown in FIgure. 13. Click on *Quantify* to recalculate the curve fit  at the new parameters.

![Quantification Dashboard](../../img/QuantFit/QuantficationDashboard.png) <center>**Figure 12.** Quantification Dashboard</center>

QuantFit plots quantified values and standard values on the calibration curve. You can optimize the curve fit from this interface or view this curve on linear and log axes for better analysis.

![Calibration curve](../../img/QuantFit/QuantificationDashboard2.png) <center>**Figure 13.** Calibration curve</center>

The *Concentration Plot* gives the concentrations across all biosamples as a barplot. The *Residue Plot* gives the residual error for the curve fit as a barplot. You can toggle between these plots by clicking on their names as shown in Figure 14.

![Residue and Concentration plot](../../img/QuantFit/QuantificationDashboard3.png) <center>**Figure 14.** Residue and Concentration plot</center>

Clicking on *Standard Data* on the *Calibration Curv*e shown in Figure 12. gives information about the standard mappings in the input file.

![Standard data](../../img/QuantFit/StandardData.png) <center>**Figure 15.** Standard data</center>

##Suggested Fits

The suggested fits option makes it possible for you to save time spent on manually curating data by removing outliers and selecting the best fit. The samples furthest from the default linear curve are removed individually and the curve fit is calculated. Subsequently the fits calcualted with the best r<sup>2</sup> apart from the default linear fit (*Custom FIt*) are displayed as *Suggested Fit 1*, *Suggested Fit 2* and *Suggested Fit 3*. You can select any fit and mark it as the default fit by clicking on *Set Fit as Default*.

![Suggested Fits](../../img/QuantFit/SuggestedFits.png) <center>**Figure 16.** Suggested Fits</center>

#Normalization

You can also normalize the quantified concentration values with respect to an internal standard's concentration values. You can select an internal standard from the list of metabolites for normalization. To normalize the concentration of a given metabolite, concentrations from individual samples are divided by the respective concentration of the internal standard.
