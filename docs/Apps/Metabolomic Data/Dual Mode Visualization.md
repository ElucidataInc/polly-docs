#Introduction

##Overview

The Dual Mode Data Visualization (Metabolomics App) allows you to perform downstream analysis on single mode (either positive or negative mode) as well as dual mode (both positive and negative mode) targeted, semi-targeted (without retention time) and untargeted unlabeled metabolomics data along with insightful visualizations. The app provides a variety of normalization methods, scaling options and data visualization functionalities, thereby allowing an efficient analysis of the data to get actionable insights.

##Scope of the App

*   The application supports data with a simple matrix having samples in the columns and metabolites in the rows.
*   It provides different normalization and scaling methods to perform on the data.
*   Performs quality checks for internal standards, metabolites, and samples.
*   Performs statistical analysis using limma and provides interactive visualizations.
*   Provides heatmap visualization along with different algorithms like hierarchical clustering, k-means, correlation etc.
*   Performs comparative analysis for the different cohort comparisons.

##Quality Checks

This tab allows you to perform quality checks for the internal standards, metabolites and across samples with the help of interactive visualizations.

**Internal Standards**

It allows you to have a look at the quality of the internal standards used in the data with the help of the different visualizations for any individual as well as for all internal standards.

*   Internal Standards (Individual): You can visualize the quality checks for any internal standard specifically. This allows you to select the internal standard by name, followed by another drop down to select by uniqueId of the feature. It’s also possible to specify the cohort order for the plots. For dual mode data, you can specify the internal standard of the particular mode from the *Select uniqueIds* drop down.

![Internal Standards (Individual) options](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_internal_standards_individual_page.png) <center>**Figure 29.** Internal Standards (Individual) options</center>

![CV Distribution across cohorts](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_indi_stds_cv_distri_across_cohorts.png) <center>**Figure 30.** CV Distribution across cohorts</center>

![CV Distribution across samples](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_indi_stds_cv_distri_samples.png) <center>**Figure 31.** CV Distribution across samples</center>

*   Metabolites: It allows you to have a look at the quality of the metabolites present in the data with the help of the Coefficient of Variation plots

    *   Metabolites CoV Boxplot visualizes the Coefficient of Variation across different cohorts in the data in the form of the boxplot. It’s also possible to specify the cohort order for the plots as shown in Figure 32.
    *   Metabolites CoV Barplot visualizes the Coefficient of Variation as a quality check for any specific metabolite. To use this, select the metabolite followed by the unique id of the feature using the drop downs shown in Figure 33. It’s also possible to specify the cohort order for the plots as shown in FIgure 33.

**PCA**

This allows you to understand the clustering pattern between biologically grouped and ungrouped samples.

*   PCA (2D) provides PCA visualization in a two-dimensional manner by selecting the PC values for *x-* and *y-* axes. It’s also possible to specify the cohort order for the plots.

![Two-dimensional PCA plot](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_2d_pca.png) <center>**Figure 36.** Two-dimensional PCA plot</center>

*   PCA (3D) provides PCA visualization in a three-dimensional manner by selecting the PC values for *x-*, *y-* and *z-* axes. It’s also possible to specify the cohort order for the plots.

![Three-dimensional PCA plot](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_3d_pca.png) <center>**Figure 37.** Three-dimensional PCA plot</center>

##Statistical Analysis

This interface allows you to perform differential expression analysis with the aim to identify metabolites whose expression differs between any specified cohort conditions. The 'limma' R package is used to identify the differentially expressed metabolites. This method creates a log<sub>2</sub> fold change ratio between the two experimental conditions and an 'adjusted' *p*-value that rates the significance of the difference.

![Statistical Analysis interface](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_stats_analysis_page.png) <center>**Figure 38.** Statistical Analysis interface</center>

The following parameters are available for selection:

*   Select *Cohort A* and *Cohort B:* Default values are filled automatically for a selected cohort condition, which can be changed as per the cohorts of interest.
*   Select *p-val* or *adj. p-val*: Select either *p*-value or adj. *p*-value for significance.
*   *p-val* or *adj. p-val* cutoff: By default, the value is 0.05 but can be changed if required.
*   *log2FC:* Specify the cut-off for log<sub>2</sub> fold change with the help of the slider.

Once the parameters are specified, click on the *Update* button to plot the volcano plot. Based on the parameters specified, a volcano plot is displayed. The volcano plot helps in visualizing metabolites that are significantly dysregulated between two cohorts.

![Volcano plot](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_volcano_plot.png) <center>**Figure 39.** Volcano plot</center>

*Filtered Metabolites Visualization* provides the visualization of cohort-based distribution of the metabolites that are significant based on the parameters specified.

![Filtered Metabolites Visualization](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_stats_analysis_filtered_metabolites_visualization.png) <center>**Figure 40.** Filtered Metabolites Visualization</center>

*Filtered Normalized Table* contains the normalized data of the metabolites that are significant based on the parameters specified.

![Filtered Normalized Table](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_stats_analysis_filtered_normalised_table.png) <center>**Figure 41.** Filtered Normalized Table</center>

![Filtered Differential Expression Table](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_stats_analysis_filtered_diff_exp_table.png) <center>**Figure 42.** Filtered Differential Expression Table</center>

*Differential Expression Table* contains all the differentially expressed metabolites without any filtering.

![Differential Expression Table](../../img/DualMode/metab_app_stats_analysis_diff_exp_table.png) <center>**Figure 43.** Differential Expression Table</center>

*Pathway Enrichment Analysis* performs the pathway enrichment analysis for the significant metabolites based on the parameters specified for the particular cohort comparison. Click on the *Perform Pathway Analysis* button.
As a result, you get Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis and Pathway Topology Analysis plots that can be downloaded under the *Plot* panel. You can also obtain the tablular representation of the plots by selecting onto the *Table* panel.

*Pathway View* plots the pathway view of the metabolites that show up in the Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis. It maps and renders the metabolite hits on relevant pathway graphs. This enables you to visualize the significant metabolites on pathway graphs of the respective metabolites they belong to. You can select your metabolite of interest from the drop-down and click on *Plot*. This will plot the pathway view of the metabolism selected. You can also download the plot as a .png file by clicking onto the *Download Pathview Plot* button.
