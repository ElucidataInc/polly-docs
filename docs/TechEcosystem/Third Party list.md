There are a number of things to consider when building a pipeline for your organization. Sometimes you hop from one platform to another to use different tools required for your analysis and are in a need to streamline your work.

Polly not only provides you its own tools to analyze the curated data on the platform but also allows the integration of tools that you already use to create a suitable “Swiss army knife” replacement.

Using third-party integrations can provide you with several advantages:

* Save time and energy to learn a new tool

* Save money on the build by tapping into existing resources.

* Get advanced Polly analytical tools and all the familiar tools that are required for your pipeline on a single platform for the comfortable work environment you needed.

* Have input and output data along with analysis stored at the same location in a Polly Workspace.

* Share the analyses along with input and output data by simply sharing the Workspace.


Currently, Polly hosts three apps:

[**El-Maven**](https://resources.elucidata.io/elmaven "https://resources.elucidata.io/elmaven"): It is an open-source LC-MS data processing engine that is optimal for isotopomer labeling and untargeted metabolomic profiling experiments. Currently, El-MAVEN exists as a desktop application that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac systems. The software can be used to view the mass spectra, align chromatograms, perform peak-feature detection, and alignment for labeled and unlabeled mass spectrometry data. The aim of this software package is to reduce the complexity of metabolomics analysis by using a highly intuitive interface for exploring and validating metabolomics data.

[**Cellxgene**](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene/ "https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene/")**:** Polly has partnered with Cellxgene so you can form more visualizations and gain more insights. The explorer makes it easier for biologists to collaboratively explore and understand their single-cell RNA-seq data.

[**SPRING App**](https://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html "https://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html"): SPRING is a tool for uncovering high-dimensional structure in single-cell gene expression data. SPRING takes a (gene X cell) table of expression measurements and outputs a k-nearest-neighbor graph rendered using a force-directed layout.

If there is an app in your mind that you’d like integrated with Polly reach out to your SPOC or our customer success team at [support.elucidata.io](http://support.elucidata.io/ "http://support.elucidata.io") to host the application you love working on, on Polly.

If you are interested in [hosting your own application on Polly](https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Host%20Apps.html "https://docs.elucidata.io/Apps/Host%20Apps.html"), give this section a read.
