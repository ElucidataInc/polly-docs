Welcome to Polly Pipelines, a powerful workflow orchestration framework designed to simplify the process of building, managing, and executing complex pipelines. With Polly Pipelines, users can focus on running their pipelines without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


## Why use Polly Pipelines?
- **Multi-language support:** Supports two languages for writing pipelines: Nextflow and Polly Workflow Language (PWL). We are planning to support Snakemake soon!
- **GUI and Programmatic Interface:** Provides user-friendly GUI and polly-python interfaces to monitor and execute pipelines
- **No infrastructure management:** Abstracts away complexities of infrastructure management and deployment. As a user, you just need to focus on writing pipelines!
- **Cloud and on-prem execution:** You can choose to execute your pipelines on cloud or on-prem. Helps you save costs! This feature is available only on Nextflow pipelines for now


If you are confused on what language to choose from while writing pipelines, please [check these guidelines](NextflowVsPWL.md)
