#Welcome to Polly!

**TEST2**Polly is an AI-enabled platform for storage, reproducible analysis and integration of high-throughput biomedical data on the cloud. Polly creates a unique, centralized ecosystem that enables a diverse team of biologists, bioinformaticians and scientific leaders to share and collaborate on projects, data and insights.

Polly combines a proprietary platform with optional, on-demand high-value bioinformatics services for biological target identification and validation, pathway elucidation, cellular phenotype analysis, and biomarker identification.

This starter guide provides a broad overview of the platform to get you started on an exciting journey of research and discovery with your data.
