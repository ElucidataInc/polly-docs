*   **For an older notebook:** You have two options, you can either launch the notebook directly by the Launch button or you can choose to edit it first before launching through the Edit and Launch button. 

**Note:**

*    Under the edit option, you can only change the machine type. The docker environment would remain the same as the one selected when you run the notebook for the first time.
