The size of the data varies from few MBs to hundreds of GBs, and in order to process and analyze this huge data, one would need the computation power from a small machine to a large workstation. Polly Notebook supports configurations having 2 to 72 GB Ram and 1 to 36 CPU cores. The menu to select a machine configuration will pop-up when you creates a new notebook or uploads a notebook and tries to open it for the first time.
