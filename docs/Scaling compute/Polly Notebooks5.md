Polly Notebook is a scalable analytics platform which allows you to perform data analysis remotely in a Jupyter-like notebook. It provides the flexibility to select the compute capacity, the environment according to your need along with the ability to share the analyses with your peers for seamless team collaboration.

Polly Notebook provides a Jupyter-like interface on the cloud. Some of the features of Polly Notebooks over other local hosting options are:

*   **Ready-to-code platform:** Installing and maintaining environments for every notebook can be a frustrating overhead. We provide custom docker environments that come pre-installed with modules commonly used in bioinformatics. You can also add your own custom docker environments.



*   **Cloud storage:** With Polly Notebooks, you can store your data files and notebooks in a single place that will be ready to run in less than 5 minutes from anywhere in the world. No need to fetch your code from Bitbucket anymore!

*   **Share and collaborate on your Workspaces:** Polly allows sharing of workspaces so you can review and refer notebooks within your team. 

*   **Resource management:** Most biological analyses (like RNAseq) are commonly resource-intensive, whether in terms of RAM or processing power. In such cases, you either have to scramble for bigger resources or compromise on the speed by using less processing power. Polly makes it possible to scale up your resources at any time.
