# Navigating the Application

## Interface Overview

The Polly KG Explorer application interface is divided into key areas designed to streamline the exploration of the knowledge graph:

- **Node Selection Panel**: Enables users to define search criteria by selecting entity categories and values. It also provides an option to download node and edge information for the filtered data.
- **Subgraph Visualization Area**: Displays the generated subgraph based on the selected filters, allowing users to explore relationships between entities.
- **Controls & Settings**: Provides tools to customize the visualization and adjust display preferences for a more tailored user experience.

 **Note:** The Download icon in the Node selection panel exports the node and edges information. The download icon in the Controls and Settings in the Sub graph visualisation area exports the generated sub graph as PNG.
