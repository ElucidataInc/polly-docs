# Introduction

## Overview

**Polly KG** is a cutting-edge knowledge graph designed to help researchers efficiently access and analyze internal and published data. It enables users to generate hypotheses and gain a comprehensive understanding of data related to specific targets, indications, and drug classes. By structuring relationships between biological entities, Polly KG eliminates siloed knowledge bases and streamlines data retrieval, empowering researchers to explore multi-modal evidence with ease.

### Key Challenges Addressed

- **Manual Data Sifting**: Traditionally, researchers manually search through internal data and external literature to validate hypotheses, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Siloed Knowledge Bases**: The lack of structured relationships between biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) leads to fragmented and inaccessible data.
- **Limited Holistic Insights**: Researchers struggle to gather and integrate multi-modal evidence to support their biological questions.
